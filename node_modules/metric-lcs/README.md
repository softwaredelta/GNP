# metric-lcs

Zero dependency [Metric Longest Common Subsequence](http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~danielry/StringMetric.pdf) implementation in js.

## Usage

`npm i metric-lcs`

```javascript
const metriclcs = require("metric-lcs");
console.log(metriclcs("ABDEF", "ABDIF")); //.8
```

## Use case

Longest Common Subsequence is used with `diff`, so the metric version of it is suitable for comparing larger strings or for comparing likely subsets of strings since it ignores edit distance and lowers the cost of insertion.
